# Dinner Date
**Dinner Date** is an implementation of a "FriendFinder" style matchmaking site. The site presents each user with a short survey asking them to provide a rating for assorted types of food. The user's responses are compared to the responses of previous users, and the site will then identify the best match for a dining companion based on similar tastes.



In its current implementation, **Dinner Date** does not feature persistant storage of user information, so user information is only retained while the server is online. Converting to a persistant database would be the next logical step for future development.
